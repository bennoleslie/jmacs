Design of jmacs
===============

What is it?
-----------

The goal of jmacs is to be a full-featured code editor that runs,
primarily, in the web browser.

Why would you want this? Well, I think operating systems are going to
move towards using the browser as the primary user-interface (e.g:
Chromium, WebOS), and I'd like a decent editor to use.

Mostly though, I'm just interested in how to go about writing an
editor.

High-level Design
-----------------

The editor is (or will be) split into the front-end, running in the
browser, and a back-end running as a web-server which provides access
to the file system.

The main components of the editor front-end are:
  * the buffer
  * the redisplay
  * the controller

The buffer is the data structure representing the current view of the
buffer. It provides a number of methods to mutate the view in various
interesting ways. Some of the operations are:
  - insert character
  - delete character
  - move cursor

The controller converts various key sequences (and other events) into
appropriate method calls on the buffer data structure.

The redisplay engine repaints the screen, calling into the buffer
object to determine the current state.


Buffer
------

The buffer represents the data as a list of lines. These are screen
lines, rather than logical lines.

The buffer also handles:
 - Cursor Position
 - Viewable area
 - Screen size

Each open file has its own 'Buffer' object. The 'Buffer' object embeds an
HTML5 canvas object.

The editor can support multiple open buffers simultaneasouly, and has the
potential with this model to display any (or all) of the buffers at once.

Commands that require arguments
---------------------------------

goto-line
find/search
replace (2 input)
run generic command (n)

-> Dialog boxes mostly suck
-> The chrome "drop down" approach is kind of nice
-> Emacs has a permanent input bar at the bottom
